    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Big Tree</strong>'s Sceletium Capsules (60 vegetarian capsules) are a traditional African mood tonic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sceletium has a long history of use in African Traditional Medicine</li>
<li><span>Elevates mood, acts as a natural anti-depressant and decreases anxiety, stress and tension</span></li>
<li><span>Also useful as a drug &amp; alcohol withdrawal aid. Sceletium is known to reduce addictive cravings particularly with regard to nicotine and also lessens the withdrawal effects of alcohol and other addictive drugs</span></li>
<li>
<span>E</span>nhances the immune response and acts as an adaptogen (similar in action to the Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceous)</li>
<li>Vegan &amp; vegetarian friendly (veggie capsule)</li>
<li><span>Free of corn, yeast, wheat, soy, salt, sugar and dairy products and formulated without preservatives, artificial colours or flavours.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><strong>BigTree Sceletium Capsules contain only: </strong>﻿100% pure Sceletium <span>tortuosum 100mg</span></p>
<p>Inactive Ingredients:<span> </span><span>Microcrystalline cellulose, Silicone dioxide, Magnesium Stearate</span></p>
<h3>Directions for use</h3>
<p><strong>Dosage</strong>: take <span>1 capsule twice daily or as directed by a healthcare practitioner.</span></p>
<p><b>Contraindications and Side Effects</b></p>
<p>Although there have been no confirmed reports of drug interactions, the neuro-receptor activities of Sceletium suggest that there may be interactions with other psychiatric medications and cardiac drugs. People taking any psychiatric drugs (including all anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-psychotics and antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors, and particularly SSRI's) are advised to not take Sceletium-containing products.</p>
<p>Please consult your health care professional before replacing any pharmaceutical antidepressant with Sceletium. When used at the recommended dose there are no documented side-effects. In large doses Sceletium can cause euphoria, but this is easily managed by reducing the dose. Do not use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Consult your doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enhances the immune response and acts as an adaptogen (similar in action to the Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceous)</li>
<li><span>Traditionally used for a variety of conditions, enhancing well-being, immune support, longevity, stress, depression and anxiety, wasting from cancer, TB, and AIDS, influenza, chronic fatigue syndrome, viral hepatitis, asthma and bronchitis, type 2 diabetes, mild to moderate hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, peptic ulcer, gastritis, reflux oesophagitis, hot flushes and irritability in menopause, and herpes. Studies also indicate significant antioxidant activity</span></li>
<li>Sutherlandia functions as an appetite stimulant in wasted patients, but not in healthy people</li>
<li>Vegan &amp; vegetarian friendly </li>
<li><span>Free of corn, yeast, wheat, soy, salt, sugar and dairy products and formulated without preservatives, artificial colours or flavours.</span></li>
<li>
<p>Organically grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides or chemical fertilizers. Pesticide residue free</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><strong>BigTree Sutherlandia Capsules contain only: </strong>﻿100% pure Sutherlandia frutescens subsp. microphylla 350mg</p>
<p>Inactive Ingredients: Vegetable cellulose capsule, Silicon dioxide, Potato starch, Magnesium Stearate</p>
<h3>Directions for use</h3>
<p><strong>Dosage</strong>: take <span>1 capsule twice daily or as directed by a healthcare practitioner.</span></p>
<p><b>Contraindications and Side Effects</b></p>
<p>When used at the recommended dose there are no documented side-effects.</p>
<p>Do not use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Dosage of anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medication may need to be reduced and preliminary studies suggest possible interactions with anti-retroviral drugs. Sutherlandia should not be taken while on anti-coagulants such as Heparin and Warfarin, and it is recommended that the use of the product be stopped two weeks prior to elective surgery.</p>
<p>Certain plants such as Sutherlandia, Astragalus and Alfalfa contain the non-protein amino acid L-canavanine. Those afflicted with Systemic Lupus Erthematosus should consult their health care professional before taking plants containing L-canavanine, as reports suggest that significant ingestion of this amino acid may cause recurrence of this disease in patients where the disease has become dormant. </p>
