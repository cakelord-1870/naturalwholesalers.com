    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Baltic Amber for Africa</strong>'s ADHD Necklace aids concentration and inner-peace in people who suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).</p>
<ul>
<li>This amber and gemstone necklace aids concentration and brings a sense of inner calm and groundedness</li>
<li>The crystals also ease other difficulties which may be associated with ADHD such as anxiety, depression, upset or anger</li>
<li><span>Carefully crafted using Cognac Amber, Smokey Quartz, Sodalite and Fluorite</span></li>
<li><span>Smokey Quartz helps you to feel grounded and is beneficial in times of stress. Smokey quartz helps to instill feelings of calmness and aids in releasing fear, especially when this is linked to failure. The grounding properties of this stone help ease hyperactivity and staying on task.<br></span></li>
<li><span>Sodalite helps to clear mental confusion and restore inner peace that has been disrupted. It encourages effective communication and calms the mind, increasing it’s ability to take in and process new information and focus.</span></li>
<li><span>Fluorite is said to absorb and neutralize all negative energies and is also known as the “Genius Stone,” as it increases concentration and helps in decision-making. Fluorite clears your mind of confusion, cluttered<br>thoughts and negativity. Fluorite heightens mental abilities, assisting in rapid organisation and processing of information.</span></li>
<li>Design feature to protect against choking if the necklace is pulled hard</li>
<li>As an additional safety feature, there is a knot before and after each bead so that in the event of it being broken, there is no risk of choking on the beads</li>
<li>Circumference size: 36 cm</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can an amber necklace help those with ADHD?</h2>
<p><strong>Baltic amber</strong> has been used for thousands of years for its beauty and healing properties. Although the exact process is unclear of how Baltic Amber is therapeutic, it is thought that when Baltic amber warms against the skin, it creates an electromagnetic field and releases succinic acid, a natural healing oil that aids against inflammation, discomfort and pain. This makes Baltic amber <strong>the perfect natural solution to help those struggling with ADHD</strong>!</p>
<p>Ancient people believed that Baltic amber would give courage to the wearer, ward off evil spirits, protect against disease, strengthen the human spirit and purify the soul. To this day Baltic amber is believed to have spiritual properties that provide psychic protection and aid manifestations.</p>
<p>Baltic amber is also referred to as an Adaptogen, which aids in the body's ability to deal with changes in the environment and stress. </p>
<h2>Directions for use</h2>
<p>The necklace is worn around your neck and the beads are NOT for chewing and sucking! The healing and stress relieving process takes place when the amber beads warm against your skin.</p>
<p>Do not use harsh detergents on your Baltic amber ADHD necklace. Simply rinse with warm water to clean and dry with a soft dry cloth. You can also rub the beads with a little olive oil to restore shine if needed. </p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Due to the nature of this product, each amber necklace is slightly different - no two are exactly the same!</p></td>
