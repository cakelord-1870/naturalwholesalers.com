<h2>How can an amber teething necklace help your teething baby?</h2>
<p><strong>Baltic amber</strong><span> </span>has been used for thousands of years for its beauty and healing properties.<span> </span><span>Although the exact process of how Baltic Amber aids against inflammation and pain is unclear, it is thought that when </span>Baltic amber warms against the skin, it creates an electromagnetic field and releases succinic acid, a natural healing oil that aids against inflammation and pain. This makes Baltic amber<span> </span><strong>the perfect natural solution to help teething babies</strong><span> </span>with sore and swollen gums, without the use of medication!</p>
<p>Ancient people believed that Baltic amber would give courage to the wearer, ward off evil spirits, protect against disease, strengthen the human spirit and purify the soul. To this day Baltic amber is believed to have spiritual properties that provide psychic protection and aid manifestations.</p>
<p>Baltic amber is also referred to as an Adaptogen, which aids in the body's ability to deal with changes in the environment and stress. </p>
<h2>Directions<span> for use</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Baltic amber teething necklaces</strong> are suitable for babies from 8 weeks and older and are safe for use during the day or the night. You can start using an amber teething necklace even before your baby starts teething. This will help your baby to become comfortable with the necklace and the sooner your baby starts wearing the necklace, the less likely he or she will be to tug on it. Your baby will also be able to immediately benefit from the healing and protective properties of the amber. </p>
<p>The necklace is worn around your baby's neck and the beads are NOT for chewing and sucking! The healing and pain relieving process takes place when the amber beads warm against your baby's skin.</p>
<p>Do not use harsh detergents on your Baltic amber teething necklace. Simply rinse with warm water to clean and dry with a soft dry cloth. You can also rub the beads with a little olive oil to restore shine if needed. </p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong><span> </span>Due to the nature of this product, each amber teething necklace is slightly different - no two are exactly the same! </p></td>

<li><span>Fluorite is said to absorb and neutralize all negative energies and is also known as the “Genius Stone,” as it increases concentration and helps in decision-making. Fluorite clears your mind of confusion, cluttered<br>thoughts and negativity. Fluorite heightens mental abilities, assisting in rapid organisation and processing of information.</span></li>

This makes Baltic amber <strong>the perfect natural solution to help teething babies</strong> with sore and swollen gums, without the use of medication!</p>
<p>Ancient people believed that Baltic amber would give courage to the wearer, ward off evil spirits, protect against disease, strengthen the human spirit and purify the soul. To this day Baltic amber is believed to have spiritual properties that provide psychic protection and aid manifestations.</p>
<p>Baltic amber is also referred to as an Adaptogen, which aids in the body's ability to deal with changes in the environment and stress. </p>
<h2>Directions for use</h2>
<p><strong>Baltic amber teething bracelets </strong>are suitable for babies from 8 weeks and older and are safe for use during the day or the night. You can start using an amber teething bracelet even before your baby starts teething. This will help your baby to become comfortable with the bracelet and the sooner your baby starts wearing the bracelet, the less likely he or she will be to tug on it. Your baby will also be able to immediately benefit from the healing and protective properties of the amber. </p>
<p>The bracelet is worn around your baby's ankle and the beads are NOT for chewing and sucking! The healing and pain relieving process takes place when the amber beads warm against your baby's skin.</p>
<p>Do not use harsh detergents on your Baltic amber teething necklace. Simply rinse with warm water to clean and dry with a soft dry cloth. You can also rub the beads with a little olive oil to restore shine if needed. </p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Due to the nature of this product, each amber teething bracelet is slightly different - no two are exactly the same!</p>

<h3>How can an amber bracelet help adults?</h3>
<p><strong>Baltic amber</strong> has been used for thousands of years for its beauty and healing properties. Although the exact process is unclear of how Baltic Amber is therapeutic, it is thought that when Baltic amber warms against the skin, it creates an electromagnetic field and releases succinic acid, a natural healing oil that aids against inflammation, discomfort and pain.
