<h2>What is Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)?</h2>
<p>EARTH Apple Cider Vinegar is made from organically grown apples and contains the famous 'Mother' = th<span>e collagen strands that help keep making vinegar. These appear as little floaty bits in the vinegar and are essential in maintaining the therapeutic benefits of the Apple Cider Vinegar. They are not usually present in non-organic store-bought apple cider vinegar,  </span></p>
<h3>How to use Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>
<p>You can drink Apple Cider Vinegar as is, but most people prefer to dilute it.</p>
<p>This is a good mix:</p>
<p><span>Add one tablespoon Apple Cider Vinegar,  1/2 juiced lemon and one teaspoon honey or maple syrup into a cup of warm water. Drink first thing in the morning, after working out, or when dehydrated.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also add a tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar to a 1/2 cup of warm water and sip slowly to relieve indigestion, heartburn or acid reflux. </span></p>
<p><span>Topically, dilute one tablespoon Apple Cider Vinegar and sponge onto itchy skin, athlete's foot or other skin conditions, or use as a hair rinse for scalp problems or dandruff. </span></p>

<li>
<strong>Jugo Beans</strong> have such a powerful natural savoury flavour with a hint of sweetness, that you don’t need to add anything but salt to enjoy</li>
<li>Rich in phytochemicals, they help lower the risk of heart disease and contain a wide range of cancer-fighting plant chemicals</li>
<li>A rich source of soluble fibre and saponins - phytochemicals that help lower unhealthy cholesterol levels in your bloodstream</li>
<li>When consumed, they slow down the release of sugar to give you a steady supply of (glucose) energy</li>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Jugo Beans.</p>
<h2>Directions for use</h2>
<p>To cook, first wash and submerge well with fresh water to soak overnight. Before cooking, drain well and rinse again. For every 1 cup of beans, add 2 cups of water or more – as they cook, they make a thick, soupy brown sauce that can be used in soups and stews for a savoury burst of flavour. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to simmer – covered – for around 1 to 1 ½ hours. Only add salt at the very end, as salt tends to harden beans while they are cooking.</p>
<p>Eat plain as a snack, or add to rice for a pilaf, or roast in the oven, or add to your favourite tomato sauce for a delicious protein b</p></td>
