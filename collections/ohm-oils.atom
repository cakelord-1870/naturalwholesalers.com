Massage into scalp and comb through the hair with a fine tooth comb, removing any lice or nits in this process. Wrap the hair in plastic or a shower cap and leave on for an hour or longer. Remove the Neem Oil with shampoo. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times per week until the nits and lice are no longer present.</p></td>
